Repeatedly using `nums.pop()` and `nums.insert(0, val)` within a `while(1)` loop results in O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list.  The `in nums` check inside the loop also adds to the overhead. The second path using dictionary is much faster but still not the optimal.
