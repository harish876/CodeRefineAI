Accessing and updating elements in a dictionary involves hashing, which adds complexity compared to direct array indexing.

This is a significant initial cost.\n\n2. **`included` dictionary and `deque` usage:** The `included` dictionary, which contains deques, is used to track whether a number from each list is included in the current window. While deques allow efficient pop operations from both ends, repeated dictionary lookups and deque appends/pops contribute to the overhead. Furthermore, the conditional checks `len(included) == len(nums)` within both while loops, followed by a full iteration through the values of `included` in the inner loop, are potentially redundant and costly.\n\n3. **`last_used_l` optimization inefficiency:** The `last_used_l` optimization isn't effective as it introduces more comparison calculations while skipping only a few potentially redundant checks. The optimization aims to prevent recomputing the minimum and maximum if `l` hasn't changed, but it's not a significant performance boost and adds complexity.\n\n4. **Calculating min/max in the inner loop:** Calculating `min_num` and `max_num` within the inner while loop by iterating through the values (deques) of the `included` dictionary is also inefficient. These values could potentially be tracked more efficiently as the window slides. This is because the min and max can only change when we remove an element from the left or add an element to the right of our window.\n        \n        Please rewrite the code based on the provided reason, and only return the corrected code, no explanation.\n        Use Python 3.8 syntax, and ensure the entire solution is enclosed in a `class Solution`, \n        maintaining the same function name as in the input code.\n        Directly begin with the correct solution which can be used in the executor, do not write anything else."

A possible optimization would be to use iterative DP with a smaller, constant-size array (rolling array technique) because the current state only depends on the previous state.
